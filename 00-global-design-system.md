# Global System Prompt - AI-Native Website Architecture

Use this document as the overarching instruction set for every page. The website must feel like an AI interface, not a traditional IT agency site. Maintain the rules below unless a page file explicitly overrides them.

## Core Philosophy
- This is not a website. This is an intelligent system interface.
- The user should feel like they are entering a living AI system.
- The site is a confident AI infrastructure and intelligence partner.
- No case studies, no portfolio, no team photos, no generic IT agency tropes.

## Brand Positioning
- "We design intelligence, not software."
- "We build thinking systems, not tools."
- "We automate decisions, not tasks."

## Visual System (Unique and Rare)
- Base: Deep Charcoal Black with subtle blue undertones (#0B0E14).
- Secondary: Muted Infra Violet (#6B5CFF, desaturated).
- Accent (active AI state only): Soft Phosphor Teal (#3AF2C2).
- Highlight (rare, insight moments): Warm Neural Amber (#F2A93B).
- Gradients appear only during "AI thinking" or "inference" moments.

## Typography
- Primary: Humanist Sans (approachable for non-technical users).
- Secondary: Technical Mono for AI states, logs, system text.
- Use mono text sparingly and only to signify "machine state."

## Motion and Interaction Principles
- All motion should imply data flow, inference, decisioning, memory retrieval.
- Use structured animations (flow lines, node activation, signal cascades).
- Micro-interactions should feel "AI-driven," not playful.
- Sound is optional and intentional; use only for AI state changes.

## Information Strategy
- Use layered comprehension: plain-language first, technical depth on reveal.
- Always allow a "technical toggle" or "expand for details."
- Present services as capabilities and outcomes, not as products.

## Global Components
### Persistent AI Voice Assistant Orb
- Location: lower right, floating, subtle pulse.
- States: idle, listening, thinking, speaking.
- Uses Accent color only when active.
- Labels rotate contextually: "Ask the AI", "Explain this", "Design my system".
- Clicking launches the external AI voice assistant app seamlessly.

### Demo CTA Pattern
- CTA style: "Experience intelligence in action".
- Demo links open external demo apps in a controlled, premium flow.
- Demos are framed as experiences, not marketing.

### CTA Strategy
- Primary CTA: voice-first when possible.
- Secondary CTA: demo experiences.
- Tertiary CTA: minimal contact form for edge cases.

## Accessibility and Clarity
- Maintain high contrast on the base background.
- Avoid excessive motion; allow motion reduction mode.
- Keep each section scannable within 5-7 seconds.

## Navigation Rules
- Only include the pages listed in the site structure.
- Navigation should feel like a system console, not a standard top bar.
- Contextual next-step prompts replace generic "Learn more".
