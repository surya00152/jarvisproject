# Page Prompt: Integrations and Data Sources

This page clarifies what data sources and systems can be connected. It should feel like a system connectivity map, not a vendor list.

## Page Intent
- Reduce technical uncertainty about data access.
- Show supported data types and integration modes.
- Encourage visitors to map their data via voice.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Map my data with the AI" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "Run the readiness diagnostic".

---

## Section 1: Integration Hero - "Your Systems Become Signals"
**Purpose**
- Frame integrations as signal intake for intelligence.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Connect signals. Build intelligence."
- Subtext: "We integrate across documents, APIs, databases, and streams."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A central "intelligence core" with faint data lines approaching.

---

## Section 2: Data Source Categories (Primary Section)
**Purpose**
- Show coverage without listing specific vendors.

**Content Intent**
- Categories: CRM, support tickets, document repositories, data lakes,
  real-time event streams, IoT and vision feeds, internal APIs.
- For each: typical signal type and AI use case.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Tiles with input icons that pulse when hovered.

---

## Section 3: Integration Modes
**Purpose**
- Explain how data is ingested and used.

**Content Intent**
- Batch ingestion, real-time streaming, API retrieval.
- Controlled access and scoped permissions.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A simple flow diagram with three paths.

---

## Section 4: Data Quality and Preparation
**Purpose**
- Set realistic expectations about readiness.

**Content Intent**
- "We evaluate signal quality before model work begins."
- "Labeling, normalization, and validation are part of the system build."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Use a "signal filter" animation with outputs stabilized.

---

## Section 5: Security and Governance Note
**Purpose**
- Build trust around integration safety.

**Content Intent**
- Least-privilege access.
- Audit trails for data access.
- Client-controlled retention.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Subtle lock indicators on data lines.

---

## Section 6: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Move visitors into a practical data conversation.

**Content Intent**
- "Tell the AI where your data lives."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Map my data with the AI" (voice).
- Secondary: "Run the readiness diagnostic".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Integrations -> Data mapping".
