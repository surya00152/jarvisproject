# Page Prompt: Impact and ROI Estimator (Non-Promissory)

This page is a calm, minimal estimator for potential impact ranges. It must avoid sales language and avoid guaranteed outcomes.

## Page Intent
- Help decision makers explore potential impact ranges.
- Provide transparent assumptions and uncertainty.
- Encourage a readiness diagnostic if inputs are weak.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Run the readiness diagnostic".
- Secondary CTA: "Ask the AI about assumptions".

## Section 1: Estimator Hero
**Purpose**
- Frame the estimator as a decision-support tool.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Estimate impact ranges, not promises."
- Subtext: "Adjust inputs to see potential outcomes."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Minimal interface with a single system panel.

---

## Section 2: Input Signals (Primary Controls)
**Purpose**
- Collect the minimum variables for a usable estimate.

**Content Intent**
- Inputs (sliders or fields):
  - Task volume per week
  - Average time per task
  - Error or rework rate
  - Peak-time load
  - Current response latency
  - Operational coverage gaps

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Inputs appear in a single vertical stack.
- Small system note for each input.

---

## Section 3: Impact Range Output
**Purpose**
- Provide conservative, transparent output ranges.

**Content Intent**
- Ranges for:
  - Time saved per week
  - Potential response improvement
  - Error reduction range
  - Coverage expansion range
- Show a confidence band based on input quality.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Output appears as a range band, not a single number.

---

## Section 4: Assumptions and Limits
**Purpose**
- Make the estimator credible and honest.

**Content Intent**
- "Estimates depend on data quality and process fit."
- "Ranges update when inputs change."
- "No claim is a guarantee."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Small mono text block with an amber "assumption" label.

---

## Section 5: Next Steps
**Purpose**
- Provide a calm, logical next step.

**Content Intent**
- If inputs are weak: prompt readiness diagnostic.
- If inputs are strong: suggest architecture mapping.

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Run the readiness diagnostic".
- Secondary: "Ask the AI about assumptions" (voice).

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Estimator -> Assumptions review".
