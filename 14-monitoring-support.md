# Page Prompt: Monitoring and Support

This page explains how AI systems are monitored, governed, and supported after launch. It should feel like an operations console.

## Page Intent
- Build confidence in long-term reliability.
- Explain monitoring, drift detection, and human oversight.
- Clarify support pathways without overstated guarantees.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Ask about system monitoring" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "Talk to the AI Architect".

## Section 1: Operations Hero
**Purpose**
- Establish the post-launch maturity of the system.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Intelligence stays intelligent."
- Subtext: "We monitor performance, drift, and safety in real time."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A live dashboard with calm, periodic signals.

---

## Section 2: Monitoring Layers
**Purpose**
- Explain what is monitored and why.

**Content Intent**
- Model performance metrics.
- Data drift and input quality.
- Latency and system health.
- Safety and guardrail triggers.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Layered rings around a core intelligence node.

---

## Section 3: Human Oversight and Overrides
**Purpose**
- Make accountability explicit.

**Content Intent**
- Human review for critical decisions.
- Override paths for high-risk actions.
- Audit trails for every decision path.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Decision nodes with a visible human gate.

---

## Section 4: Support and Response
**Purpose**
- Clarify how issues are handled.

**Content Intent**
- Incident detection, triage, and resolution workflow.
- Support channels and escalation paths.
- Service levels are defined per deployment.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Timeline flow from detection to resolution.

---

## Section 5: Continuous Improvement
**Purpose**
- Show how intelligence improves safely over time.

**Content Intent**
- Retraining cycles based on monitored outcomes.
- Controlled rollouts and rollback options.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A circular loop with controlled checkpoints.

---

## Section 6: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Provide a direct path for operational questions.

**Content Intent**
- "Ask the AI how we monitor your system."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Ask about system monitoring" (voice).
- Secondary: "Talk to the AI Architect".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Monitoring -> Support inquiry".
