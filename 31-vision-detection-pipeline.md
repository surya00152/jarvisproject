# Page Prompt: Vision Detection Pipeline

This page explains a structured computer vision pipeline for detection, tracking, and action. It must feel precise and engineering-led.

## Page Intent
- Show how vision systems operate from capture to action.
- Clarify accuracy, latency, and safety controls.
- Reinforce real-world readiness without sales tone.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Ask the AI about vision pipelines" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "See the reference architecture".

---

## Section 1: Vision Pipeline Hero
**Purpose**
- Frame vision as a system pipeline, not a feature.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Vision becomes decisions."
- Subtext: "From frames to actions with measurable control."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A thin-line pipeline with frame-to-action flow.

---

## Section 2: Detection Pipeline (Primary Diagram)
**Purpose**
- Show the full detection flow.

**Content Intent**
- Steps:
  1. Capture and preprocess frames
  2. Detect objects (YOLO or custom model)
  3. Track and classify
  4. Apply rules and thresholds
  5. Trigger action or alert

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Each stage lights in sequence with short labels.

---

## Section 3: Latency and Deployment Modes
**Purpose**
- Explain edge vs cloud and response time considerations.

**Content Intent**
- Edge inference for low latency.
- Cloud inference for heavy models.
- Hybrid routing based on load.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A split path with edge and cloud branches.

---

## Section 4: Accuracy and Safety Controls
**Purpose**
- Show how vision reliability is maintained.

**Content Intent**
- Confidence thresholds and human review.
- Drift monitoring and re-calibration.
- False positive controls.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Threshold lines with a visible safety band.

---

## Section 5: Actions and Integration
**Purpose**
- Show how detections connect to workflows.

**Content Intent**
- Alerts, ticketing, automation triggers.
- Audit trail for every detection event.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Output nodes that fan into system actions.

---

## Section 6: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Offer a technical entry point without pressure.

**Content Intent**
- "Describe what you need the system to see."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Ask the AI about vision pipelines" (voice).
- Secondary: "See the reference architecture".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Vision -> Pipeline inquiry".
