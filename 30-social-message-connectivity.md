# Page Prompt: Social Message Connectivity

This page shows how social and messaging channels connect into the AI system. It must feel like a clean ingestion and routing blueprint.

## Page Intent
- Show multi-channel intake without vendor hype.
- Explain normalization, routing, and safe handling.
- Make message-to-action flow credible and clear.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Ask the AI to map your channels" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "See the reference architecture".

## Section 1: Connectivity Hero
**Purpose**
- Define the channel layer as part of the system.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Messages become signals."
- Subtext: "Every channel flows into a single intelligence layer."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A hub-and-spoke intake diagram with a central signal core.

## Section 2: Channel Intake Map (Primary Diagram)
**Purpose**
- Show how channels enter the system.

**Content Intent**
- Channels: web chat, email, messaging apps, social DMs, CRM inbox.
- A single normalization layer converts all formats into signals.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Lines converge into a normalization node.
- Each channel lights on hover.

## Section 6: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Invite a channel mapping conversation.

**Content Intent**
- "Tell the AI where your messages live."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Ask the AI to map your channels" (voice).
- Secondary: "See the reference architecture".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Connectivity -> Channel mapping".
