# Page Prompt: Agentic Tech Flow

This page explains how agentic systems operate, orchestrate tools, and stay safe. It must feel like a system blueprint, not a buzzword page.

## Page Intent
- Make "agentic" tangible with clear system stages.
- Show how planning, tool use, and memory work together.
- Prove control, safety, and observability of autonomy.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Ask the AI about agentic systems" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "See how intelligence is built".

---

## Section 1: Agentic Flow Hero
**Purpose**
- Define agentic intelligence in one precise frame.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Agents perceive, plan, and act."
- Subtext: "Autonomy with guardrails and traceability."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A loop diagram: Perception -> State -> Plan -> Tools -> Action -> Review -> Memory.
- Only the active node glows in accent.

---

## Section 2: The Agentic Loop (Core Diagram)
**Purpose**
- Show the full loop and where control lives.

**Content Intent**
- Perception: signals and context intake.
- State: current world model.
- Planning: goal decomposition and steps.
- Tools: controlled tool invocation.
- Action: system execution.
- Review: evaluation and correction.
- Memory: long-term retrieval and update.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A continuous loop with a slow, deliberate flow line.
- Hover reveals a short plain-language explanation.

---

## Section 3: Tool Orchestration Layer
**Purpose**
- Explain how tools are selected, constrained, and executed.

**Content Intent**
- Tool registry and permissions.
- Task router and agent roles.
- Safe execution sandbox.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A layered stack with a clear "policy gate" before tool calls.

---

## Section 4: Tool Invocation Trace Mesh
**Purpose**
- Visualize every tool call as a traceable, auditable path.

**Content Intent**
- Each tool call is logged with input, output, and policy result.
- Trace IDs allow replay and inspection.
- Tool calls are rate-limited and scoped.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A trace mesh overlays the tool layer with thin, linear paths.
- Each invocation creates a short-lived trace line with a visible ID tag.
- Policy gate stamp appears on approval or block.

---

## Section 5: Multi-Agent Orchestration Diagram (Required)
**Purpose**
- Visualize how agent roles coordinate in real time.
- Make orchestration feel controlled, not chaotic.

**Content Intent**
- Roles: Planner, Executor, Verifier.
- Message passing and consensus checks.
- Shared memory hub and task queue.
- Tool call sequencing with policy gates.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A role lattice: three agent nodes orbit a shared memory core.
- A task queue flows into the Planner, then routes to Executor.
- Verifier sends a green or amber signal back to the Planner.
- A "consensus ring" pulses only when agreement is reached.
- Hover on any signal reveals a short mono "trace step."

---

## Section 6: Conflict Resolution and Arbitration
**Purpose**
- Show how agents resolve disagreements safely.

**Content Intent**
- Conflicts trigger a verification loop.
- Arbitration rules decide when to retry, escalate, or halt.
- Human approval is required for unresolved conflicts.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A split-path visualization that merges only after resolution.
- An amber "conflict flag" appears and clears on resolution.
- A short "reason code" appears in mono text.

---

## Section 7: Agent Orchestration Timeline
**Purpose**
- Show the full sequence from goal to tool execution.

**Content Intent**
- Step 1: Goal received.
- Step 2: Plan decomposed into tasks.
- Step 3: Tools selected with permissions.
- Step 4: Execution with monitored outcomes.
- Step 5: Verification and memory update.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A horizontal timeline with a single moving "agent token."
- Each step expands to show a one-line system note.

---

## Section 8: Safety, Control, and Auditability
**Purpose**
- Prove that autonomy is controlled and observable.

**Content Intent**
- Human approval gates for high-risk actions.
- Full trace of decisions and tool usage.
- Rollback and safe-mode controls.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Guardrail lines in amber and a visible audit trail.

---

## Section 9: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Move advanced buyers into conversation.

**Content Intent**
- "Describe the tasks you want agents to handle."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Ask the AI about agentic systems" (voice).
- Secondary: "See how intelligence is built".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Agentic -> Architecture inquiry".
