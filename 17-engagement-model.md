# Page Prompt: Engagement Model - Pilot to Production

This page explains how AI systems move from pilot to production. It should feel like a structured system rollout, not a sales funnel.

## Page Intent
- Clarify the engagement path without case studies.
- Set expectations for scope, outcomes, and gates.
- Reduce uncertainty for enterprise decision makers.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Start with a system pilot" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "Run the readiness diagnostic".

---

## Section 1: Engagement Hero
**Purpose**
- Frame the engagement as a controlled rollout.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Pilot intelligence before full deployment."
- Subtext: "Clear scope, measurable signals, defined outcomes."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A staged pipeline with locked gates that open sequentially.

---

## Section 2: The Engagement Stages (Primary Section)
**Purpose**
- Explain the phases in simple, credible steps.

**Stages**
1. Signal Alignment (objectives, constraints, success criteria)
2. Data Access and Validation
3. Prototype Intelligence (small, fast proof)
4. Pilot System (real users, monitored)
5. Production Deployment
6. Continuous Optimization

**Content Intent**
- Each stage includes: intent, deliverable, and exit criteria.
- Use plain language with a technical toggle.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Each stage illuminates as the user scrolls.

---

## Section 3: Success Criteria and Gates
**Purpose**
- Show that progression is earned, not assumed.

**Content Intent**
- Define measurable outcomes per stage.
- The system moves forward only when criteria are met.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Gate icons appear between stages.

---

## Section 4: Collaboration Model
**Purpose**
- Clarify roles without heavy process language.

**Content Intent**
- Your team provides domain knowledge and access.
- Our team builds and monitors intelligence.
- The AI assistant keeps alignment transparent.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Two-layer flow converging into a system core.

---

## Section 5: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Encourage a low-friction start.

**Content Intent**
- "Start with a pilot and measure real outcomes."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Start with a system pilot" (voice).
- Secondary: "Run the readiness diagnostic".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Engagement -> Pilot planning".
