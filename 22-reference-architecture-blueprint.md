# Page Prompt: Reference Architecture Blueprint

This page presents a single, clean canonical AI system stack. It should feel like an engineering blueprint, not a case study.

## Page Intent
- Provide a default AI system architecture in one view.
- Help technical buyers map the stack to their environment.
- Reinforce credibility without sales language.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Ask the AI to map this to your stack" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "Open the procurement pack".

---

## Section 1: Blueprint Hero
**Purpose**
- Establish the architecture as a system standard.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Canonical AI system architecture."
- Subtext: "A default stack built for intelligence, safety, and control."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A thin-line blueprint diagram with subtle activation pulses.

---

## Section 2: The Canonical Stack (Primary Diagram)
**Purpose**
- Show the full system in a single view.

**Content Intent**
- Layers from bottom to top:
  1. Signal Intake (APIs, streams, documents, vision)
  2. Data Intelligence Layer (validation, labeling, normalization)
  3. Retrieval and Memory (vector DB, RAG)
  4. Model Reasoning (LLMs, vision models)
  5. Orchestration (agent routing, tool policy)
  6. Action Layer (automation, alerts, workflows)
  7. Monitoring and Safety (drift, accuracy, guardrails)
  8. Governance (audit, access, compliance)

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Each layer highlights on hover with a one-line explanation.
- A slow signal flow moves upward through the stack.

---

## Section 3: Variant Modules (Optional)
**Purpose**
- Show how the stack adapts to voice, vision, or RAG-heavy systems.

**Content Intent**
- Toggle variants:
  - Voice-first system
  - Vision-first system
  - RAG-heavy system
  - Agentic system

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Toggling swaps in a highlighted sub-layer.

---

## Section 4: Boundaries and Control
**Purpose**
- Clarify what is controlled, isolated, and auditable.

**Content Intent**
- Data boundaries are client-defined.
- Policy gates before tool execution.
- Full trace of decisions and outputs.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Boundary lines appear in amber.

---

## Section 5: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Offer a technical conversation without sales pressure.

**Content Intent**
- "Ask the AI to map this architecture to your environment."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Ask the AI to map this to your stack" (voice).
- Secondary: "Open the procurement pack".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Architecture -> Blueprint mapping".
