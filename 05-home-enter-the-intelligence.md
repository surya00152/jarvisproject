# Page Prompt: Home - "Enter the Intelligence"

Use this page to create the first impression of an AI system interface. The page must feel alive, structured, and intelligent. This is the most cinematic page, but still precise and calm.

## Page Intent
- Position the company as an AI infrastructure and intelligence partner.
- Make the visitor feel they are entering a living AI system.
- Convert curiosity into action (voice assistant or demos).

## Primary Audience
- Non-technical executives who need clarity and trust.
- Technical leads who need credibility and architecture signals.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: Voice assistant entry ("Ask the AI", "Design my system").
- Secondary CTA: Demo experiences.
- Tertiary CTA: Explore AI capabilities page.

## Section 1: AI Awakening Hero
**Purpose**
- Establish the "AI interface" feel immediately.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "We design intelligence, not software."
- Subtext: "Automation. Reasoning. Vision. Voice. Intelligence."
- One short line that implies systems-level thinking.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Dark canvas with a subtle neural structure forming from data points.
- Node activations pulse gently in the accent color only during "thinking".
- When the page loads, the system "awakens" (data points converge).

**Interactions**
- Hovering on the neural structure reveals short "system logs" in mono text.
- The hero responds to cursor or touch with a slow parallax drift.

**CTA Placement**
- Primary CTA in the hero: "Ask the AI" (launch external voice assistant).
- Secondary CTA: "Experience intelligence in action" (scrolls to demos).

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- The floating orb appears immediately in the lower-right corner.
- Copy rotates: "Ask the AI", "Explain this", "Design my system".
- Clicking the orb opens the external AI app with no friction.

## Section 2: What This AI Can Do (Non-Technical Friendly)
**Purpose**
- Translate AI capabilities into human outcomes.

**Content Intent**
- Use plain-language labels (e.g., "AI that talks to customers").
- Each card expands to reveal technical depth (LLMs, RAG, vector DB).
- Show input -> inference -> output visually.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Cards appear as tiles on a system grid.
- On expand, a micro-animation shows data flow through a model.

**CTA Placement**
- Inline CTA on each expanded card: "See how it is built".

---

## Section 3: AI System Map (Core Differentiator)
**Purpose**
- Show the architecture as a living system.

**Content Intent**
- The system map is: Data -> Models -> Memory -> Decisions -> Actions.
- Hover reveals two layers: non-technical explanation and technical hint.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Nodes connected by animated signal lines.
- When a node is focused, connected nodes glow subtly.

**CTA Placement**
- Link to "How Intelligence Is Built" page.

---

## Section 4: Try Intelligence (Demo CTA #1)
**Purpose**
- Convert curiosity into belief via real experiences.

**Content Intent**
- 3-4 demo tiles: "Conversational AI", "Vision Intelligence", "AI Automation".
- Each tile describes what it does and the tech used.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Tiles look like lab modules with subtle system status indicators.

**CTA Placement**
- "Launch Experience" opens external demo apps in a new tab.
- "See all live experiences" links to demo hub page.

---

## Section 5: Voice-First Conversion
**Purpose**
- Make voice the primary conversion path.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Do not read. Just speak."
- Explain: The AI assistant will qualify needs and propose a path.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Large central voice orb with a quiet pulse.
- On hover, the orb emits a soft waveform line.

**CTA Placement**
- Primary button: "Talk to the AI Architect".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Home -> Conversion".

---

## Section 6: Footer System Prompt
**Purpose**
- Provide minimal navigation and trust anchors.

**Content Intent**
- Short, calm footer with system-like navigation.
- Include privacy and ethics statement link.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Footer appears like a "system status panel".

**CTA Placement**
- Subtle "Contact via AI" entry point.
