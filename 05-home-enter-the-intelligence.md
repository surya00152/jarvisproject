# Page Prompt: Home - "Enter the Intelligence"

Use this page to create the first impression of an AI system interface. The page must feel alive, structured, and intelligent. This is the most cinematic page, but still precise and calm.

## Page Intent
- Position the company as an AI infrastructure and intelligence partner.
- Make the visitor feel they are entering a living AI system.
- Convert curiosity into action (voice assistant or demos).

## Primary Audience
- Non-technical executives who need clarity and trust.
- Technical leads who need credibility and architecture signals.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: Voice assistant entry ("Ask the AI", "Design my system").
- Secondary CTA: System atlas modules (quick routing).
- Tertiary CTA: Demo experiences and AI capabilities.

## Section 1: Intelligence World Portal Hero
**Purpose**
- Deliver a 70 percent first-impression moment.
- Make the visitor feel they crossed into an intelligence layer.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Enter the intelligence layer."
- Subtext: "Signals. Memory. Decisions. Actions."
- Short line: "This is an AI interface, not a website."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A multi-layer 3D "intelligence world": signal plane, model lattice, memory rings,
  and an action horizon.
- Data streams fall into a central inference core, then radiate outward as decisions.
- Subtle camera drift and depth-of-field create a world-like presence.
- Accent color appears only when the system "thinks."

**Interactions**
- Cursor or touch creates localized inference ripples in the lattice.
- Hover reveals a small mono "system log" anchored to the hovered node.
- Scroll nudges the camera to reveal hidden layers, not just parallax.

**CTA Placement**
- Primary CTA in the hero: "Ask the AI" (launch external voice assistant).
- Secondary CTA: "Explore the system atlas" (scrolls to Section 2).

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- The floating orb appears immediately in the lower-right corner.
- Copy rotates: "Ask the AI", "Explain this", "Design my system".
- Clicking the orb opens the external AI app with no friction.

## Section 2: System Atlas (Whole Website Overview)
**Purpose**
- Cover the entire website in short, navigable modules.
- Provide a direct route to any page without breaking the flow.

**Content Intent**
- Title: "System atlas"
- Subhead: "Every module in one map."
- Each card has a single-line summary and routes to a specific page.

**Modules and Destinations**
- Capabilities -> AI capabilities page
- Build pipeline -> How intelligence is built page
- Agentic flow -> Agentic tech flow page
- Live demos -> Live AI experiences page
- Scenarios -> Industries and use scenarios page
- Why different -> Positioning page
- Talk to the AI -> Contact page
- Readiness diagnostic -> Readiness page
- Integrations -> Integrations and data sources page
- Engagement model -> Pilot to production page
- Monitoring and support -> Monitoring page
- Privacy and ethics -> Privacy page
- Security and compliance -> Security page
- System status -> Research log page
- Legal and accessibility -> Legal page
- AI procurement FAQ -> Procurement Q and A page
- Reference architecture -> Architecture blueprint page
- Impact estimator -> Impact and ROI estimator page
- Change management -> Human-in-the-loop page
- Model evaluation -> Safety metrics page
- Procurement pack -> Procurement pack page
- RAG blueprint -> RAG system blueprint page
- Social connectivity -> Social message connectivity page
- Vision pipeline -> Vision detection pipeline page

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Cards appear as a constellation around a central intelligence core.
- Cluster labels: "Core Intelligence", "Proof and Experience",
  "Trust and Governance", "Deployment Path", "Enterprise Readiness",
  "System Patterns".
- Hovering a card highlights its cluster and draws a short signal line.

**CTA Placement**
- Each module card is a CTA.
- A small "Guided path" CTA opens the voice assistant to recommend a route.

## Section 3: What This AI Can Do (Non-Technical Friendly)
**Purpose**
- Translate AI capabilities into human outcomes.

**Content Intent**
- Use plain-language labels (e.g., "AI that talks to customers").
- Each card expands to reveal technical depth (LLMs, RAG, vector DB).
- Show input -> inference -> output visually.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Cards appear as tiles on a system grid.
- On expand, a micro-animation shows data flow through a model.

**CTA Placement**
- Inline CTA on each expanded card: "See how it is built".

---

## Section 4: AI System Map (Core Differentiator)
**Purpose**
- Show the architecture as a living system.

**Content Intent**
- The system map is: Data -> Models -> Memory -> Decisions -> Actions.
- Hover reveals two layers: non-technical explanation and technical hint.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Nodes connected by animated signal lines.
- When a node is focused, connected nodes glow subtly.

**CTA Placement**
- Link to "How Intelligence Is Built" page.

---

## Section 5: Try Intelligence (Demo CTA #1)
**Purpose**
- Convert curiosity into belief via real experiences.

**Content Intent**
- 3-4 demo tiles: "Conversational AI", "Vision Intelligence", "AI Automation".
- Each tile describes what it does and the tech used.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Tiles look like lab modules with subtle system status indicators.

**CTA Placement**
- "Launch Experience" opens external demo apps in a new tab.
- "See all live experiences" links to demo hub page.

---

## Section 6: Voice-First Conversion
**Purpose**
- Make voice the primary conversion path.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Do not read. Just speak."
- Explain: The AI assistant will qualify needs and propose a path.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Large central voice orb with a quiet pulse.
- On hover, the orb emits a soft waveform line.

**CTA Placement**
- Primary button: "Talk to the AI Architect".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Home -> Conversion".

---

## Section 7: Footer System Prompt
**Purpose**
- Provide minimal navigation and trust anchors.

**Content Intent**
- Short, calm footer with system-like navigation.
- Include privacy and ethics statement link.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Footer appears like a "system status panel".

**CTA Placement**
- Subtle "Contact via AI" entry point.
