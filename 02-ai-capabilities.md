# Page Prompt: What We Actually Do - AI Capabilities

This page makes capabilities concrete and credible without overwhelming. It should feel like a system catalog, not a service list.

## Page Intent
- Explain the full AI capability spectrum in clear, layered language.
- Show how human problems translate into AI systems.
- Confirm technical depth without heavy jargon overload.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Talk to the AI Architect" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "Experience a live demo".
- Tertiary CTA: "See how intelligence is built".

## Section 1: Capabilities Overview Hero
**Purpose**
- Establish the "capability catalog" feel.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Capabilities that become intelligence."
- Subtext: "We build AI systems across voice, vision, reasoning, and automation."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Light system grid overlay on the dark base.
- Subtle data pulses across the grid.

---

## Section 2: Capability Explorer (Primary Section)
**Purpose**
- Present every core capability with layered depth.

**Content Intent**
Each capability card includes:
- Human problem statement (plain language).
- AI approach (short explanation).
- Underlying tech stack (toggle).
- Outcome (what changes for the user).

**Capabilities to include**
1. AI Automation (business and operations)
2. AI Chatbots (text, multi-channel)
3. AI Voice Assistants (real-time, conversational)
4. AI-powered Lead Generation Systems
5. Computer Vision (YOLO-based and custom models)
6. Fine-tuning Large Language Models
7. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
8. Vector Databases and AI Search
9. AI Insight Dashboards and Analytics
10. Training Custom LLMs (private, domain-specific)
11. Training Custom Vision Models

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Cards animate with input -> inference -> output flow.
- When expanded, technical text appears in mono with a system reveal.

**Interaction**
- Allow filters by "Voice", "Vision", "Reasoning", "Automation".
- Hovering a card highlights related capabilities.

---

## Section 3: Capability Relationships Map
**Purpose**
- Demonstrate that capabilities are designed as a system.

**Content Intent**
- Show how RAG connects to Vector DB, and to Dashboards.
- Show how Voice and Chat tie into Lead Gen and Automation.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Node-link diagram with slow, deliberate signal movement.

**CTA Placement**
- "See the system map in action" links to Process page.

---

## Section 4: Real-World Outcome Strip
**Purpose**
- Translate technical capabilities into business impact.

**Content Intent**
- 3-4 short outcome statements (e.g., "90% faster resolution", "24/7 intelligent handling").
- Keep it credible and grounded, no wild claims.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Outcome statements appear like system status results.

---

## Section 5: Voice and Demo Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Provide a clear action path after comprehension.

**Content Intent**
- Copy: "Tell the AI what you need. It will design the system."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Talk to the AI Architect" (voice).
- Secondary: "Launch a live demo".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Capabilities -> Qualification".

**Demo Integration**
- If a user selects a capability, suggest the most relevant demo tile.
