# Page Prompt: Model Evaluation and Safety Metrics

This page presents how model quality and safety are measured. It must feel rigorous and transparent, not promotional.

## Page Intent
- Show evaluation methods and metrics clearly.
- Explain how drift, hallucination, and safety risks are managed.
- Build confidence for technical and risk-focused teams.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Ask the AI about evaluation metrics" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "See monitoring and support".

## Section 1: Evaluation Hero
**Purpose**
- Set a rigorous, engineering-led tone.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Measure intelligence, not just outputs."
- Subtext: "Accuracy, drift, and safety are continuously evaluated."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A metrics dashboard strip with minimal movement.

---

## Section 2: Core Metrics (Primary Section)
**Purpose**
- Make evaluation tangible and credible.

**Content Intent**
- Metrics to show:
  - Accuracy and task success rate
  - Precision and recall (for classification)
  - Hallucination rate (for LLMs)
  - Latency and throughput
  - Drift detection and data shift
  - Safety incident rate

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Metric cards with short definitions and thresholds.

---

## Section 3: Evaluation Pipeline
**Purpose**
- Explain how metrics are produced and validated.

**Content Intent**
- Offline benchmarks before deployment.
- Online monitoring and sampling.
- Human review for high-risk outputs.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A three-stage pipeline with a slow flow line.

---

## Section 4: Safety Testing and Red Teaming
**Purpose**
- Show proactive safety work.

**Content Intent**
- Adversarial testing and abuse cases.
- Guardrail validation and safe-mode triggers.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Red-team nodes that illuminate briefly in amber.

---

## Section 5: Reporting and Thresholds
**Purpose**
- Show how metrics drive real decisions.

**Content Intent**
- Thresholds for escalation.
- Rollback or retraining triggers.
- Transparent reporting cadence.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Threshold line with a visible trigger marker.

---

## Section 6: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Invite technical conversations without sales pressure.

**Content Intent**
- "Ask the AI how we measure quality and safety."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Ask the AI about evaluation metrics" (voice).
- Secondary: "See monitoring and support".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Evaluation -> Metrics".
