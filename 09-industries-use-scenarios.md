# Page Prompt: Industries and Use Scenarios

This page avoids generic industry lists. It uses real scenarios and signals when AI becomes necessary. It should feel like a diagnostic interface.

## Page Intent
- Show how AI applies to real operational moments.
- Make both technical and non-technical users feel "seen."
- Encourage visitors to describe their scenario via voice.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Describe your scenario to the AI."
- Secondary CTA: "Try a relevant demo."

---

## Section 1: Scenario Hero - "When Intelligence Becomes Necessary"
**Purpose**
- Frame the page around triggers, not verticals.

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "When systems overload, intelligence steps in."
- Subtext: "Choose the scenario that matches your reality."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A faint signal waveform across the hero.

---

## Section 2: Scenario Cards (Primary Section)
**Purpose**
- Present AI use scenarios as system triggers.

**Scenario Examples**
- "When customer volume spikes overnight."
- "When humans cannot monitor everything in real time."
- "When decisions must be made in seconds."
- "When data lives across disconnected systems."
- "When knowledge is trapped in documents."
- "When visual inspection is too slow or inconsistent."

**Content Intent (per scenario)**
- Short human description.
- AI capabilities activated (automation, voice, vision, LLMs, RAG).
- Outcome: what improves immediately.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Each card lights up with a short signal pulse on hover.
- Clicking expands a "solution stack" view.

**CTA Placement**
- "Speak this scenario to the AI" (voice).
- "See a live demo that matches" (demo link).

---

## Section 3: Scenario-to-System Mapper
**Purpose**
- Show how scenarios map to system components.

**Content Intent**
- A visual mapping from scenario to capabilities to system outputs.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Animated lines connect scenario nodes to capability nodes.

---

## Section 4: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Turn scenario recognition into action.

**Content Intent**
- "Tell the AI your scenario. It will build the system plan."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Talk to the AI Architect" (voice).
- Secondary: "Go to live demos".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Scenarios -> Qualification".
