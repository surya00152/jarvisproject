# Page Prompt: How Intelligence Is Built - The Process

This page replaces traditional agency process with an AI system build pipeline. It should feel like a controlled lab process, not a sales funnel.

## Page Intent
- Prove that the company builds real intelligence systems.
- Make the process understandable to non-technical leaders.
- Provide technical hooks for engineers and AI teams.

## CTA Strategy (page level)
- Primary CTA: "Talk to the AI Architect" (voice).
- Secondary CTA: "Explore live demos".

## Section 1: Process Hero - System Build Mode
**Purpose**
- Transition from "what we do" to "how we build intelligence."

**Content Intent**
- Headline: "Intelligence is built, not bought."
- Short line: "Every system follows a structured intelligence pipeline."

**Design and Animation Logic**
- A vertical or horizontal pipeline with active nodes.
- Only the current node glows in accent color.

---

## Section 2: Six-Stage Intelligence Pipeline
**Purpose**
- Show the true AI build steps, not generic agency steps.

**Stages**
1. Signal Understanding
2. Data Intelligence Layer
3. Model Reasoning
4. Memory and Retrieval
5. Autonomous Action
6. Continuous Learning

**Content Intent (per stage)**
- Plain explanation for non-technical users.
- "Technical toggle" reveals architecture hints and terms.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- When a stage is selected, a simulated flow runs through it.
- Use slow, precise motion to imply computation.

---

## Section 3: Technical Depth Panels (Optional Expand)
**Purpose**
- Provide credibility for AI engineers and technical leads.

**Content Intent**
- Short, structured explanations of:
  - Data validation and labeling.
  - Model selection and evaluation.
  - RAG + vector search architecture.
  - Deployment, monitoring, and drift management.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Panels open like system drawers, with mono text.

---

## Section 4: Reliability, Ethics, and Constraints
**Purpose**
- Build trust with explicit constraints and safeguards.

**Content Intent**
- Commitments: privacy, accuracy thresholds, guardrails, auditability.
- Explain how constraints are engineered, not just promised.

**Design and Animation Logic**
- Use minimal amber highlights for "risk checks."

---

## Section 5: Conversion Panel
**Purpose**
- Convert intent into a real conversation.

**Content Intent**
- "Describe your signals, we will build the intelligence."

**CTA Placement**
- Primary: "Talk to the AI Architect" (voice).
- Secondary: "See live demos".

**AI Voice Assistant Integration**
- Launch external voice app with context: "Process -> System design".
